## These are two slightly different versions of the same application, based on the actual build.

#### See the blog article [Halloween Props with Moving Head and Sound](https://resinchemtech.blogspot.com/2021/11/halloween-props-with-moving-head-and.html) for full build details, controller wiring and more.

The Goblin version offers independent eye control (color and blinking), while the Skull version has single control for both eyes.  There are wiring differences in the controller, so the two versions are not interchangeable.

Assure you are selecting the proper version for your particular controller and build.
