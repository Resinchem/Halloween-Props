### Skull Head Build
![Thumb_Github_Skull](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55962781/138799966-4a101207-3d32-4d2d-bfb0-f639cbda6fc5.jpg)

These files are designed for the controller board built for the Skull Head.  These files **will not** work with the Goblin Head controller version. See the blog [Halloween Props with Moving Head and Sound](https://resinchemtech.blogspot.com/2021/11/halloween-props-with-moving-head-and.html) for build details and the differences between the two versions.

#### You MUST edit the Credentials.h and Settings.h files before installation to your controller.  See the [wiki](https://github.com/Resinchem/Halloween-Props/wiki) for more information.
