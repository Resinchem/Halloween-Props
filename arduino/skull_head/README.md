These files are designed for the controller board built for the Skull Head.  These files **will not** work with the Goblin Head controller version. See the blog [Halloween Props with Moving Head and Sound](https://resinchemtech.blogspot.com/2021/10/halloween-props-with-moving-head-and.html) for build details and the differences between the two versions.

#### You MUST edit the Credentials.h and Settings.h files before installation to your controller.  See the wiki for more information.
