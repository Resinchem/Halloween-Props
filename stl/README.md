## 3D Printed Parts

#### These are the .stl files for the 3D printed parts I used, as described in the full detail build blog article at [Halloween Props with Moving Head and Sound](https://resinchemtech.blogspot.com/2021/11/halloween-props-with-moving-head-and.html)

If you do not have access to a 3D printer, you may still be able to complete the project, but will have to find alternate methods for some steps like attaching the head platform to the servo platform.
